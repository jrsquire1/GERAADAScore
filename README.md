# GERAADAScore
This projects is a Python script that automates entry of variables and retrieval of GERAADA risk scores from the Shiny app that hosts it.

The GERAADA score is a clinical tool designed to predict the 30-day mortality in patients who are undergoing surgery for acute aortic dissection. It is notable for being the first score created specifically for this purpose and also the first for emergency cardiac surgery. The score is available on a web-based platform, making it easily accessible, and it utilizes very basic preoperative clinical parameters to make its predictions

This script was developed as part of an ongoing research project to validate the GERAADA score in the US population.
